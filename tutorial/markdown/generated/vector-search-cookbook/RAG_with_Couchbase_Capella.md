# Introduction
In this guide, we will walk you through building a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application using Couchbase Capella as the database, [Llama 3.1 8B Instruct](https://www.llama.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/llama3_1/) model as the as the large language model provided by Couchbase Capella AI Services. We will use the [e5-mistral-7b-instruct](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-mistral-7b-instruct) model for generating embeddings via the Capella AI Services. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional RAG system using Capella AI Services and [LangChain](https://langchain.com/).

# How to run this tutorial

This tutorial is available as a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) that you can run interactively. You can access the original notebook [here](https://github.com/couchbase-examples/vector-search-cookbook/blob/main/capella-ai/RAG_with_Couchbase_Capella.ipynb).

You can either download the notebook file and run it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or run it on your system by setting up the Python environment.

# Before you start

## Create and Deploy Your Operational cluster on Capella

To get started with Couchbase Capella, create an account and use it to deploy an operational cluster.

To know more, please follow the [instructions](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/get-started/create-account.html).


### Couchbase Capella Configuration

When running Couchbase using [Capella](https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-in), the following prerequisites need to be met:

* Have a multi-node Capella cluster running the Data, Query, Index, and Search services.
* Create the [database credentials](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/manage-database-users.html) to access the travel-sample bucket (Read and Write) used in the application.
* [Allow access](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/allow-ip-address.html) to the Cluster from the IP on which the application is running.

### Deploy Models

In order to create the RAG application, we need an embedding model to ingest the documents for Vector Search and a large language model (LLM) for generating the responses based on the context. 

Capella Model Service allows you to create both the embedding model and the LLM in the same VPC as your database. Currently, the service offers Llama 3.1 Instruct model with 8 Billion parameters as an LLM and the mistral model for embeddings. 

Create the models using the Capella AI Services interface. While creating the model, it is possible to cache the responses (both standard and semantic cache) and apply guardrails to the LLM responses.

For more details, please refer to the [documentation](https://preview2.docs-test.couchbase.com/ai/get-started/about-ai-services.html#model). These models are compatible with the [LangChain OpenAI integration](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/openai/index.html).


# Installing Necessary Libraries
To build our RAG system, we need a set of libaries. The libraries we install handle everything from connecting to databases to performing AI tasks. Each library has a specific role: Couchbase libraries manage database operations, LangChain handles AI model integrations, and we will use the OpenAI SDK for generating embeddings and calling the LLM in Capella AI services. By setting up these libraries, we ensure our environment is equipped to handle the tasks required for RAG.


```python
!pip install --quiet datasets langchain-couchbase langchain-openai
```

# Importing Necessary Libraries
The script starts by importing a series of libraries required for various tasks, including handling JSON, logging, time tracking, Couchbase connections, embedding generation, and dataset loading. These libraries provide essential functions for working with data, managing database connections, and processing machine learning models.


```python
import getpass
import json
import logging
import sys
import time

from datetime import timedelta

from couchbase.auth import PasswordAuthenticator
from couchbase.cluster import Cluster
from couchbase.exceptions import CouchbaseException
from couchbase.management.search import SearchIndex
from couchbase.options import ClusterOptions

from datasets import load_dataset

from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough
from langchain_couchbase.vectorstores import CouchbaseVectorStore
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings

from tqdm import tqdm
import base64
```

# Loading Sensitive Information
In this section, we prompt the user to input essential configuration settings needed. These settings include sensitive information like database credentials and collection names. Instead of hardcoding these details into the script, we request the user to provide them at runtime, ensuring flexibility and security.

The script also validates that all required inputs are provided, raising an error if any crucial information is missing. This approach ensures that your integration is both secure and correctly configured without hardcoding sensitive information, enhancing the overall security and maintainability of your code.

CAPELLA_AI_ENDPOINT is the Capella AI Services endpoint found in the models section.

> Note that the Capella AI Endpoint also requires an additional `/v1` from the endpoint shown on the UI if it is not shown on the UI.

INDEX_NAME is the name of the search index we will use for the vector search.


```python
CB_CONNECTION_STRING = getpass.getpass("Enter your Couchbase Connection String: ")
CB_USERNAME = input("Enter your Couchbase Database username: ")
CB_PASSWORD = getpass.getpass("Enter your Couchbase Database password: ")
CB_BUCKET_NAME = input("Enter your Couchbase bucket name: ")
SCOPE_NAME = input("Enter your scope name: ")
COLLECTION_NAME = input("Enter your collection name: ")
INDEX_NAME = input("Enter your Search index name: ")
CAPELLA_AI_ENDPOINT = getpass.getpass("Enter your Capella AI Services Endpoint: ")

# Check if the variables are correctly loaded
if not all(
    [
        CB_CONNECTION_STRING,
        CB_USERNAME,
        CB_PASSWORD,
        CB_BUCKET_NAME,
        CAPELLA_AI_ENDPOINT,
        SCOPE_NAME,
        COLLECTION_NAME,
        INDEX_NAME,
    ]
):
    raise ValueError("Missing required environment variables variables")
```

    Enter your Couchbase Connection String:  ········
    Enter your Couchbase Database username:  Admin
    Enter your Couchbase Database password:  ········
    Enter your Couchbase bucket name:  model_tutorial
    Enter your scope name:  rag
    Enter your collection name:  data
    Enter your Search index name:  vs-index
    Enter your Capella AI Services Endpoint:  ········


# Generating Credentials for Capella Model Service
In Capella AI Services, the models are accessed using basic authentication with the linked Capella cluster credentials. We generate the credentials using the following code snippet:


```python
key_string = f"{CB_USERNAME}:{CB_PASSWORD}"
CAPELLA_AI_KEY = base64.b64encode(key_string.encode("utf-8"))
```

# Connecting to the Couchbase Cluster
Couchbase will serve as our primary data store, handling all the storage and retrieval operations required for our RAG system. By establishing this connection, we enable our application to interact with the database, allowing us to perform operations such as storing embeddings, querying data, and managing collections.


```python
try:
    auth = PasswordAuthenticator(CB_USERNAME, CB_PASSWORD)
    options = ClusterOptions(auth)
    cluster = Cluster(CB_CONNECTION_STRING, options)
    cluster.wait_until_ready(timedelta(seconds=5))
    print("Successfully connected to Couchbase")
except Exception as e:
    raise ConnectionError(f"Failed to connect to Couchbase: {str(e)}")
```

    Successfully connected to Couchbase


# Setting Up Collections in Couchbase
In Couchbase, data is organized in buckets, which can be further divided into scopes and collections. Think of a collection as a table in a traditional SQL database. Before we can store any data, we need to ensure that our collections exist. If they don't, we must create them. This step is important because it prepares the database to handle the specific types of data our application will process. By setting up collections, we define the structure of our data storage, which is essential for efficient data retrieval and management.

Moreover, setting up collections allows us to isolate different types of data within the same bucket, providing a more organized and scalable data structure. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets, as it ensures that related data is stored together, making it easier to manage and query. Here, we also set up the primary index for query operations on the collection and clear the existing documents in the collection if any. If you do not want to do that, please skip this step.


```python
def setup_collection(cluster, bucket_name, scope_name, collection_name, flush_collection=False):
    try:
        bucket = cluster.bucket(bucket_name)
        bucket_manager = bucket.collections()

        # Check if the collection exists, create if it doesn't
        collections = bucket_manager.get_all_scopes()
        collection_exists = any(
            scope.name == scope_name
            and collection_name in [col.name for col in scope.collections]
            for scope in collections
        )

        if not collection_exists:
            print(
                f"Collection '{collection_name}' does not exist. Creating it..."
            )
            bucket_manager.create_collection(scope_name, collection_name)
            print(f"Collection '{collection_name}' created successfully.")
        else:
            print(
                f"Collection '{collection_name}' already exists. Skipping creation."
            )

        collection = bucket.scope(scope_name).collection(collection_name)

        # Ensure primary index exists
        try:
            cluster.query(
                f"CREATE PRIMARY INDEX IF NOT EXISTS ON `{bucket_name}`.`{scope_name}`.`{collection_name}`"
            ).execute()
            print("Primary index present or created successfully.")
        except Exception as e:
            logging.warning(f"Error creating primary index: {str(e)}")

        if flush_collection:
            # Clear all documents in the collection
            try:
                query = f"DELETE FROM `{bucket_name}`.`{scope_name}`.`{collection_name}`"
                cluster.query(query).execute()
                print("All documents cleared from the collection.")
            except Exception as e:
                print(
                    f"Error while clearing documents: {str(e)}. The collection might be empty."
                )

    except Exception as e:
        raise print(f"Error setting up collection: {str(e)}")


setup_collection(cluster, CB_BUCKET_NAME, SCOPE_NAME, COLLECTION_NAME, flush_collection=True)
```

    Collection 'data' already exists. Skipping creation.
    Primary index present or created successfully.
    All documents cleared from the collection.


# Loading Couchbase Vector Search Index

Semantic search requires an efficient way to retrieve relevant documents based on a user's query. This is where the Couchbase Vector Search comes into play. In this step, we load the Vector Search Index definition from a JSON file, which specifies how the index should be structured. This includes the fields to be indexed, the dimensions of the vectors, and other parameters that determine how the search engine processes queries based on vector similarity.

Note that you might have to update the index parameters depending on the names of your bucket, scope and collection. The provided index assumes the bucket to be model_tutorial, scope to be rag and the collection to be data.

For more information on creating a vector search index, please follow the [instructions](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/vector-search/create-vector-search-index-ui.html).

To import the index into Capella via the UI, please follow the [instructions](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/search/import-search-index.html) on the documentation.

There is code to create the index using the SDK as well below if you want to do it via code.


```python
# If you are running this script in Google Colab, comment the following line
# and provide the path to your index definition file.

index_definition_path = "capella_index.json"  # Local setup: specify your file path here

# If you are running in Google Colab, use the following code to upload the index definition file
# from google.colab import files
# print("Upload your index definition file")
# uploaded = files.upload()
# index_definition_path = list(uploaded.keys())[0]

try:
    with open(index_definition_path, "r") as file:
        index_definition = json.load(file)
except Exception as e:
    raise ValueError(
        f"Error loading index definition from {index_definition_path}: {str(e)}"
    )
```

# Creating or Updating Search Indexes

With the index definition loaded, the next step is to create or update the Vector Search Index in Couchbase. This step is crucial because it optimizes our database for vector similarity search operations, allowing us to perform searches based on the semantic content of documents rather than just keywords. By creating or updating a Vector Search Index, we enable our RAG to handle complex queries that involve finding semantically similar documents using vector embeddings, which is essential for a robust RAG system.


```python
# Create the Vector Index via SDK
try:
    scope_index_manager = (
        cluster.bucket(CB_BUCKET_NAME).scope(SCOPE_NAME).search_indexes()
    )

    # Check if index already exists
    existing_indexes = scope_index_manager.get_all_indexes()
    index_name = index_definition["name"]

    if index_name in [index.name for index in existing_indexes]:
        logging.info(f"Index '{index_name}' found")
    else:
        logging.info(f"Creating new index '{index_name}'...")

    # Create SearchIndex object from JSON definition
    search_index = SearchIndex.from_json(index_definition)

    # Upsert the index (create if not exists, update if exists)
    scope_index_manager.upsert_index(search_index)
    logging.info(f"Index '{index_name}' successfully created/updated.")

except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Index exists: {e}")
```

# Load the BBC News Dataset
To build a RAG engine, we need data to search through. We use the [BBC Realtime News dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/RealTimeData/bbc_news_alltime), a dataset with up-to-date BBC news articles grouped by month. This dataset contains articles that were created after the LLM was trained. It will showcase the use of RAG to augment the LLM. 

The BBC News dataset's varied content allows us to simulate real-world scenarios where users ask complex questions, enabling us to fine-tune our RAG's ability to understand and respond to various types of queries.


```python
try:
    news_dataset = load_dataset('RealTimeData/bbc_news_alltime', '2024-12', split="train")
    print(f"Loaded the BBC News dataset with {len(news_dataset)} rows")
except Exception as e:
    raise ValueError(f"Error loading TREC dataset: {str(e)}")

Just a day earlier, faith healer Bibi - wrapped in a white shawl, her face covered by a white veil - stood atop a shipping container on the edge of the city as thousands of her husband’s devoted followers waved flags and chanted slogans beneath her. It was the latest protest to flare since Khan, the 72-year-old cricketing icon-turned-politician, was jailed more than a year ago after falling foul of the country\'s influential military which helped catapult him to power. “My children and my brothers! You have to stand with me,” Bibi cried on Tuesday afternoon, her voice cutting through the deafening roar of the crowd. “But even if you don’t,” she continued, “I will still stand firm. “This is not just about my husband. It is about this country and its leader.” It was, noted some watchers of Pakistani politics, her political debut. But as the sun rose on Wednesday morning, there was no sign of Bibi, nor the thousands of protesters who had marched through the country to the heart of the capital, demanding the release of their jailed leader. While other PMs have fallen out with Pakistan\'s military in the past, Khan\'s refusal to stay quiet behind bars is presenting an extraordinary challenge - escalating the standoff and leaving the country deeply divided. Exactly what happened to the so-called “final march”, and Bibi, when the city went dark is still unclear. All eyewitnesses like Samia* can say for certain is that the lights went out suddenly, plunging D Chowk, the square where they had gathered, into blackness.\n\nWithin a day of arriving, the protesters had scattered - leaving behind Bibi\'s burnt-out vehicle\n\nAs loud screams and clouds of tear gas blanketed the square, Samia describes holding her husband on the pavement, bloodied from a gun shot to his shoulder. "Everyone was running for their lives," she later told BBC Urdu from a hospital in Islamabad, adding it was "like doomsday or a war". "His blood was on my hands and the screams were unending.” But how did the tide turn so suddenly and decisively? Just hours earlier, protesters finally reached D Chowk late afternoon on Tuesday. They had overcome days of tear gas shelling and a maze of barricaded roads to get to the city centre. Many of them were supporters and workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), the party led by Khan. He had called for the march from his jail cell, where he has been for more than a year on charges he says are politically motivated. Now Bibi - his third wife, a woman who had been largely shrouded in mystery and out of public view since their unexpected wedding in 2018 - was leading the charge. “We won’t go back until we have Khan with us,” she declared as the march reached D Chowk, deep in the heart of Islamabad’s government district.\n\nThousands had marched for days to reach Islamabad, demanding former Prime Minister Imran Khan be released from jail\n\nInsiders say even the choice of destination - a place where her husband had once led a successful sit in - was Bibi’s, made in the face of other party leader’s opposition, and appeals from the government to choose another gathering point. Her being at the forefront may have come as a surprise. Bibi, only recently released from prison herself, is often described as private and apolitical. Little is known about her early life, apart from the fact she was a spiritual guide long before she met Khan. Her teachings, rooted in Sufi traditions, attracted many followers - including Khan himself. Was she making her move into politics - or was her sudden appearance in the thick of it a tactical move to keep Imran Khan’s party afloat while he remains behind bars? For critics, it was a move that clashed with Imran Khan’s oft-stated opposition to dynastic politics. There wasn’t long to mull the possibilities. After the lights went out, witnesses say that police started firing fresh rounds of tear gas at around 21:30 local time (16:30 GMT). The crackdown was in full swing just over an hour later. At some point, amid the chaos, Bushra Bibi left. Videos on social media appeared to show her switching cars and leaving the scene. The BBC couldn’t verify the footage. By the time the dust settled, her container had already been set on fire by unknown individuals. By 01:00 authorities said all the protesters had fled.\n\nSecurity was tight in the city, and as night fell, lights were switched off - leaving many in the dark as to what exactly happened next\n\nEyewitnesses have described scenes of chaos, with tear gas fired and police rounding up protesters. One, Amin Khan, said from behind an oxygen mask that he joined the march knowing that, "either I will bring back Imran Khan or I will be shot". The authorities have have denied firing at the protesters. They also said some of the protesters were carrying firearms. The BBC has seen hospital records recording patients with gunshot injuries. However, government spokesperson Attaullah Tarar told the BBC that hospitals had denied receiving or treating gunshot wound victims. He added that "all security personnel deployed on the ground have been forbidden" from having live ammunition during protests. But one doctor told BBC Urdu that he had never done so many surgeries for gunshot wounds in a single night. "Some of the injured came in such critical condition that we had to start surgery right away instead of waiting for anaesthesia," he said. While there has been no official toll released, the BBC has confirmed with local hospitals that at least five people have died. Police say at least 500 protesters were arrested that night and are being held in police stations. The PTI claims some people are missing. And one person in particular hasn’t been seen in days: Bushra Bibi.\n\nThe next morning, the protesters were gone - leaving behind just wrecked cars and smashed glass\n\nOthers defended her. “It wasn’t her fault,” insisted another. “She was forced to leave by the party leaders.” Political commentators have been more scathing. “Her exit damaged her political career before it even started,” said Mehmal Sarfraz, a journalist and analyst. But was that even what she wanted? Khan has previously dismissed any thought his wife might have her own political ambitions - “she only conveys my messages,” he said in a statement attributed to him on his X account.\n\nImran Khan and Bushra Bibi, pictured here arriving at court in May 2023, married in 2018\n\nSpeaking to BBC Urdu, analyst Imtiaz Gul calls her participation “an extraordinary step in extraordinary circumstances". Gul believes Bushra Bibi’s role today is only about “keeping the party and its workers active during Imran Khan’s absence”. It is a feeling echoed by some PTI members, who believe she is “stepping in only because Khan trusts her deeply”. Insiders, though, had often whispered that she was pulling the strings behind the scenes - advising her husband on political appointments and guiding high-stakes decisions during his tenure. A more direct intervention came for the first time earlier this month, when she urged a meeting of PTI leaders to back Khan’s call for a rally. Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif accused her of “opportunism”, claiming she sees “a future for herself as a political leader”. But Asma Faiz, an associate professor of political science at Lahore University of Management Sciences, suspects the PTI’s leadership may have simply underestimated Bibi. “It was assumed that there was an understanding that she is a non-political person, hence she will not be a threat,” she told the AFP news agency. “However, the events of the last few days have shown a different side of Bushra Bibi.” But it probably doesn’t matter what analysts and politicians think. Many PTI supporters still see her as their connection to Imran Khan. It was clear her presence was enough to electrify the base. “She is the one who truly wants to get him out,” says Asim Ali, a resident of Islamabad. “I trust her. Absolutely!”', 'Walleys Quarry was ordered not to accept any new waste as of Friday\n\nA chemist and former senior lecturer in environmental sustainability has said powerful odours from a controversial landfill site may be linked to people doing more DIY during the Covid-19 pandemic. Complaints about Walleys Quarry in Silverdale, Staffordshire – which was ordered to close as of Friday – increased significantly during and after coronavirus lockdowns. Issuing the closure notice, the Environment Agency described management of the site as poor, adding it had exhausted all other enforcement tactics at premises where gases had been noxious and periodically above emission level guidelines - which some campaigners linked to ill health locally. Dr Sharon George, who used to teach at Keele University, said she had been to the site with students and found it to be clean and well-managed, and suggested an increase in plasterboard heading to landfills in 2020 could be behind a spike in stenches.\n\n“One of the materials that is particularly bad for producing odours and awful emissions is plasterboard," she said. “That’s one of the theories behind why Walleys Quarry got worse at that time.” She said the landfill was in a low-lying area, and that some of the gases that came from the site were quite heavy. “They react with water in the atmosphere, so some of the gases you smell can be quite awful and not very good for our health. “It’s why, on some days when it’s colder and muggy and a bit misty, you can smell it more.” Dr George added: “With any landfill, you’re putting things into the ground – and when you put things into the ground, if they can they will start to rot. When they start to rot they’re going to give off gases.” She believed Walleys Quarry’s proximity to people’s homes was another major factor in the amount of complaints that arose from its operation. “If you’ve got a gas that people can smell, they’re going to report it much more than perhaps a pollutant that might go unnoticed.”\n\nRebecca Currie said she did not think the site would ever be closed\n\nLocal resident and campaigner Rebecca Currie said the closure notice served to Walleys Quarry was "absolutely amazing". Her son Matthew has had breathing difficulties after being born prematurely with chronic lung disease, and Ms Currie says the site has made his symptoms worse. “I never thought this day was going to happen,” she explained. “We fought and fought for years.” She told BBC Midlands Today: “Our community have suffered. We\'ve got kids who are really poorly, people have moved homes.”\n\nComplaints about Walleys Quarry to Newcastle-under-Lyme Borough Council exceeded 700 in November, the highest amount since 2021 according to council leader Simon Tagg. The Environment Agency (EA), which is responsible for regulating landfill sites, said it had concluded further operation at the site could result in "significant long-term pollution". A spokesperson for Walley\'s Quarry Ltd said the firm rejected the EA\'s accusations of poor management, and would be challenging the closure notice.

## Cleaning up the Data

We will use the content of the news articles for our RAG system. 

The dataset contains a few duplicate records. We are removing them to avoid duplicate results in the retrieval stage of our RAG system.


```python
news_articles = news_dataset["content"]
unique_articles = set()
for article in news_articles:
    if article:
        unique_articles.add(article)
unique_news_articles = list(unique_articles)
print(f"We have {len(unique_news_articles)} unique articles in our database.")
```

    We have 1749 unique articles in our database.


# Creating Embeddings using Capella AI Service
Embeddings are at the heart of semantic search. They are numerical representations of text that capture the semantic meaning of the words and phrases. Unlike traditional keyword-based search, which looks for exact matches, embeddings allow our search engine to understand the context and nuances of language, enabling it to retrieve documents that are semantically similar to the query, even if they don't contain the exact keywords. By creating embeddings using Capella AI service, we equip our RAG system with the ability to understand and process natural language in a way that is much closer to how humans understand language. This step transforms our raw text data into a format that the Capella vector store can use to find and rank relevant documents.

We are using the OpenAI Embeddings via the [LangChain OpenAI provider](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/openai/) with a few extra parameters specific to the Capella AI Services such as disabling the tokenization and handling of longer inputs using the LangChain handler. We provide the model and api_key and the URL for the SDK to those for Capella AI Services.


```python
try:
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(
        openai_api_key=CAPELLA_AI_KEY,
        openai_api_base=CAPELLA_AI_ENDPOINT,
        check_embedding_ctx_length=False,
        tiktoken_enabled=False,
        model="intfloat/e5-mistral-7b-instruct",
    )
    print("Successfully created CapellaAIEmbeddings")
except Exception as e:
    raise ValueError(f"Error creating CapellaAIEmbeddings: {str(e)}")
```

    Successfully created CapellaAIEmbeddings


# Testing the Embeddings Model
We can test the embeddings model by generating an embedding for a string using the LangChain OpenAI package


```python
print(len(embeddings.embed_query("this is a test sentence")))

```

#  Setting Up the Couchbase Vector Store
The vector store is set up to store the documents from the dataset. The vector store is essentially a database optimized for storing and retrieving high-dimensional vectors. In this case, the vector store is using Couchbase using the [LangChain integration](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/couchbase/).


```python
try:
    vector_store = CouchbaseVectorStore(
        cluster=cluster,
        bucket_name=CB_BUCKET_NAME,
        scope_name=SCOPE_NAME,
        collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,
        embedding=embeddings,
        index_name=INDEX_NAME,
    )
    print("Successfully created vector store")
except Exception as e:
    raise ValueError(f"Failed to create vector store: {str(e)}")
```

    Successfully created vector store


# Saving Data to the Vector Store
With the Vector store set up, the next step is to populate it with data. We save the BBC articles dataset to the vector store. For each document, we will generate the embeddings for the article to use with the semantic search using LangChain.

Here one of the articles is larger than the maximum tokens that we can use for our embedding model. If we want to ingest that document, we could split the document and ingest it in parts. However, since it is only a single document for simplicity, we ignore that document from the ingestion process.


```python
from langchain_core.documents import Document
from uuid import uuid4

for article in tqdm(unique_news_articles, desc="Ingesting articles"):
    try:
        documents = [Document(page_content=article)]
        uuids = [str(uuid4()) for _ in range(len(documents))]
        vector_store.add_documents(documents=documents)
    except Exception as e:

# Using the Large Language Model (LLM) in Capella AI
Language language models are AI systems that are trained to understand and generate human language. We'll be using the `Llama3.1-8B-Instruct` large language model via the Capella AI services inside the same network as the Capella operational database to process user queries and generate meaningful responses. This model is a key component of our RAG system, allowing it to go beyond simple keyword matching and truly understand the intent behind a query. By creating this language model, we equip our RAG system with the ability to interpret complex queries, understand the nuances of language, and provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

The language model's ability to understand context and generate coherent responses is what makes our RAG system truly intelligent. It can not only find the right information but also present it in a way that is useful and understandable to the user.

The LLM has been created using the LangChain OpenAI provider as well with the model name, URL and the API key based on the Capella AI Services.


```python
try:
    llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_base=CAPELLA_AI_ENDPOINT, openai_api_key=CAPELLA_AI_KEY, model="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", temperature=0)

# Perform Semantic Search
Semantic search in Couchbase involves converting queries and documents into vector representations using an embeddings model. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text and are stored directly in Couchbase. When a query is made, Couchbase performs a similarity search by comparing the query vector against the stored document vectors. The similarity metric used for this comparison is configurable, allowing flexibility in how the relevance of documents is determined. Common metrics include cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or dot product, but other metrics can be implemented based on specific use cases. Different embedding models like BERT, Word2Vec, or GloVe can also be used depending on the application's needs, with the vectors generated by these models stored and searched within Couchbase itself.

In the provided code, the search process begins by recording the start time, followed by executing the `similarity_search_with_score` method of the `CouchbaseVectorStore`. This method searches Couchbase for the most relevant documents based on the vector similarity to the query. The search results include the document content and a similarity score that reflects how closely each document aligns with the query in the defined semantic space. The time taken to perform this search is then calculated and logged, and the results are displayed, showing the most relevant documents along with their similarity scores. This approach leverages Couchbase as both a storage and retrieval engine for vector data, enabling efficient and scalable semantic searches. The integration of vector storage and search capabilities within Couchbase allows for sophisticated semantic search operations without relying on external services for vector storage or comparison.


```python
query = "What was Pep Guardiola's reaction to Manchester City's current form?"

try:
    # Perform the semantic search
    start_time = time.time()
    search_results = vector_store.similarity_search_with_score(query, k=5)
    search_elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time

    # Display search results
    print(
        f"\nSemantic Search Results (completed in {search_elapsed_time:.2f} seconds):"

    Erling Haaland was part of the Manchester City side that won the Champions League for the first time in 2023
    
    Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola says the club are in danger of missing out on a place in next season's Champions League. City are currently in their 14th consecutive season in European football's most prestigious club competition. Only Arsenal between 1998 and 2017, and Manchester United between 1996 and 2014, have a longer record of qualifying among English clubs. City are seventh in the Premier League after 17 matches, four points behind Nottingham Forest in fourth and a point behind fifth-placed Bournemouth. England are currently top of Uefa's European Performance Spot table and well placed to secure a fifth place in next season's Champions League, although City would still not qualify on current standings. "When I said before, people laughed," said Guardiola. "They said, 'qualifying for the Champions League is not a big success'. "But I know it because it happens with clubs in this country. They were dominant for many years and after they were many years not qualifying for the Champions League."
    
    Guardiola's side host Everton on Boxing Day, before a trip to Leicester on 29 December and a home match against West Ham on 4 January. Given all three opponents are in the bottom seven, it offers City a chance to improve on an appalling recent record of four points from eight games, which Guardiola acknowledges has left their lofty European ambitions in doubt. "The one team that has been in the Champions League for the past years has been Manchester City," he added. "Now we are at risk, of course we are. Definitely." Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United finished in the Premier League's top four from the 2005-06 season to 2008-09. At least three of them also occupied the top four spots for 15 successive campaigns until 2012. But United have spent five out of the past 11 seasons outside the Champions League. Arsenal spent six seasons out of the competition before returning last term. Liverpool missed out all but one year in seven from 2010, while Chelsea are in their second successive campaign outside Europe's elite. This term the threat to City comes from unexpected sources. As well as Forest and Bournemouth, Aston Villa are ahead of City, while Newcastle, Fulham and Brighton are also within a couple of points. "There are a lot of contenders," said Guardiola, whose side have lost nine of their last 12 games in all competitions. "For every club it is so important and if we are not winning games, we will be out. "If we don't qualify it is because we don't deserve it, because we were not prepared and because we had a lot of problems and didn't solve them."

    This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. 'Worrying' and 'staggering' - Why do Manchester City keep conceding?
    
    Manchester City are currently in relegation form and there is little sign of it ending. Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa left them joint bottom of the form table over the past eight games with just Southampton for company. Saints, at the foot of the Premier League, have the same number of points, four, as City over their past eight matches having won one, drawn one and lost six - the same record as the floundering champions. And if Southampton - who appointed Ivan Juric as their new manager on Saturday - get at least a point at Fulham on Sunday, City will be on the worst run in the division. Even Wolves, who sacked boss Gary O'Neil last Sunday and replaced him with Vitor Pereira, have earned double the number of points during the same period having played a game fewer. They are damning statistics for Pep Guardiola, even if he does have some mitigating circumstances with injuries to Ederson, Nathan Ake and Ruben Dias - who all missed the loss at Villa Park - and the long-term loss of midfield powerhouse Rodri. Guardiola was happy with Saturday's performance, despite defeat in Birmingham, but there is little solace to take at slipping further out of the title race. He may have needed to field a half-fit Manuel Akanji and John Stones at Villa Park but that does not account for City looking a shadow of their former selves. That does not justify the error Josko Gvardiol made to gift Jhon Duran a golden chance inside the first 20 seconds, or £100m man Jack Grealish again failing to have an impact on a game. There may be legitimate reasons for City's drop off, whether that be injuries, mental fatigue or just simply a team coming to the end of its lifecycle, but their form, which has plunged off a cliff edge, would have been unthinkable as they strolled to a fourth straight title last season. "The worrying thing is the number of goals conceded," said ex-England captain Alan Shearer on BBC Match of the Day. "The number of times they were opened up because of the lack of protection and legs in midfield was staggering. There are so many things that are wrong at this moment in time."

    Afterwards Guardiola was calm, so much so it was difficult to hear him in the news conference, a contrast to the frustrated figure he cut on the touchline. He said: "It depends on us. The solution is bring the players back. We have just one central defender fit, that is difficult. We are going to try next game - another opportunity and we don't think much further than that. "Of course there are more reasons. We concede the goals we don't concede in the past, we [don't] score the goals we score in the past. Football is not just one reason. There are a lot of little factors. "Last season we won the Premier League, but we came here and lost. We have to think positive and I have incredible trust in the guys. Some of them have incredible pride and desire to do it. We have to find a way, step by step, sooner or later to find a way back." Villa boss Unai Emery highlighted City's frailties, saying he felt Villa could seize on the visitors' lack of belief. "Manchester City are a little bit under the confidence they have normally," he said. "The second half was different, we dominated and we scored. Through those circumstances they were feeling worse than even in the first half."
    
    Erling Haaland had one touch in the Villa box
    
    There are chinks in the armour never seen before at City under Guardiola and Erling Haaland conceded belief within the squad is low. He told TNT after the game: "Of course, [confidence levels are] not the best. We know how important confidence is and you can see that it affects every human being. That is how it is, we have to continue and stay positive even though it is difficult." Haaland, with 76 goals in 83 Premier League appearances since joining City from Borussia Dortmund in 2022, had one shot and one touch in the Villa box. His 18 touches in the whole game were the lowest of all starting players and he has been self critical, despite scoring 13 goals in the top flight this season. Over City's last eight games he has netted just twice though, but Guardiola refused to criticise his star striker. He said: "Without him we will be even worse but I like the players feeling that way. I don't agree with Erling. He needs to have the balls delivered in the right spots but he will fight for the next one."

    Pep Guardiola has not been through a moment like this in his managerial career. Manchester City have lost nine matches in their past 12 - as many defeats as they had suffered in their previous 106 fixtures. At the end of October, City were still unbeaten at the top of the Premier League and favourites to win a fifth successive title. Now they are seventh, 12 points behind leaders Liverpool having played a game more. It has been an incredible fall from grace and left people trying to work out what has happened - and whether Guardiola can make it right. After discussing the situation with those who know him best, I have taken a closer look at the future - both short and long term - and how the current crisis at Man City is going to be solved.
    
    Pep Guardiola's Man City have lost nine of their past 12 matches
    
    Guardiola has also been giving it a lot of thought. He has not been sleeping very well, as he has said, and has not been himself at times when talking to the media. He has been talking to a lot of people about what is going on as he tries to work out the reasons for City's demise. Some reasons he knows, others he still doesn't. What people perhaps do not realise is Guardiola hugely doubts himself and always has. He will be thinking "I'm not going to be able to get us out of this" and needs the support of people close to him to push away those insecurities - and he has that. He is protected by his people who are very aware, like he is, that there are a lot of people that want City to fail. It has been a turbulent time for Guardiola. Remember those marks he had on his head after the 3-3 draw with Feyenoord in the Champions League? He always scratches his head, it is a gesture of nervousness. Normally nothing happens but on that day one of his nails was far too sharp so, after talking to the players in the changing room where he scratched his head because of his usual agitated gesturing, he went to the news conference. His right-hand man Manel Estiarte sent him photos in a message saying "what have you got on your head?", but by the time Guardiola returned to the coaching room there was hardly anything there again. He started that day with a cover on his nose after the same thing happened at the training ground the day before. Guardiola was having a footballing debate with Kyle Walker about positional stuff and marked his nose with that same nail. There was also that remarkable news conference after the Manchester derby when he said "I don't know what to do". That is partly true and partly not true. Ignore the fact Guardiola suggested he was "not good enough". He actually meant he was not good enough to resolve the situation with the group of players he has available and with all the other current difficulties. There are obviously logical explanations for the crisis and the first one has been talked about many times - the absence of injured midfielder Rodri. You know the game Jenga? When you take the wrong piece out, the whole tower collapses. That is what has happened here. It is normal for teams to have an over-reliance on one player if he is the best in the world in his position. And you cannot calculate the consequences of an injury that rules someone like Rodri out for the season. City are a team, like many modern ones, in which the holding midfielder is a key element to the construction. So, when you take Rodri out, it is difficult to hold it together. There were Plan Bs - John Stones, Manuel Akanji, even Nathan Ake - but injuries struck. The big injury list has been out of the ordinary and the busy calendar has also played a part in compounding the issues. However, one factor even Guardiola cannot explain is the big uncharacteristic errors in almost every game from international players. Why did Matheus Nunes make that challenge to give away the penalty against Manchester United? Jack Grealish is sent on at the end to keep the ball and cannot do that. There are errors from Walker and other defenders. These are some of the best players in the world. Of course the players' mindset is important, and confidence is diminishing. Wrong decisions get taken so there is almost panic on the pitch instead of calm. There are also players badly out of form who are having to play because of injuries. Walker is now unable to hide behind his pace, I'm not sure Kevin de Bruyne is ever getting back to the level he used to be at, Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gundogan do not have time to rest, Grealish is not playing at his best. Some of these players were only meant to be playing one game a week but, because of injuries, have played 12 games in 40 days. It all has a domino effect. One consequence is that Erling Haaland isn't getting the service to score. But the Norwegian still remains City's top-scorer with 13. Defender Josko Gvardiol is next on the list with just four. The way their form has been analysed inside the City camp is there have only been three games where they deserved to lose (Liverpool, Bournemouth and Aston Villa). But of course it is time to change the dynamic.
    
    Guardiola has never protected his players so much. He has not criticised them and is not going to do so. They have won everything with him. Instead of doing more with them, he has tried doing less. He has sometimes given them more days off to clear their heads, so they can reset - two days this week for instance. Perhaps the time to change a team is when you are winning, but no-one was suggesting Man City were about to collapse when they were top and unbeaten after nine league games. Some people have asked how bad it has to get before City make a decision on Guardiola. The answer is that there is no decision to be made. Maybe if this was Real Madrid, Barcelona or Juventus, the pressure from outside would be massive and the argument would be made that Guardiola has to go. At City he has won the lot, so how can anyone say he is failing? Yes, this is a crisis. But given all their problems, City's renewed target is finishing in the top four. That is what is in all their heads now. The idea is to recover their essence by improving defensive concepts that are not there and re-establishing the intensity they are known for. Guardiola is planning to use the next two years of his contract, which is expected to be his last as a club manager, to prepare a new Manchester City. When he was at the end of his four years at Barcelona, he asked two managers what to do when you feel people are not responding to your instructions. Do you go or do the players go? Sir Alex Ferguson and Rafael Benitez both told him that the players need to go. Guardiola did not listen because of his emotional attachment to his players back then and he decided to leave the Camp Nou because he felt the cycle was over. He will still protect his players now but there is not the same emotional attachment - so it is the players who are going to leave this time. It is likely City will look to replace five or six regular starters. Guardiola knows it is the end of an era and the start of a new one. Changes will not be immediate and the majority of the work will be done in the summer. But they are open to any opportunities in January - and a holding midfielder is one thing they need. In the summer City might want to get Spain's Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad and they know 60m euros (£50m) will get him. He said no to Liverpool last summer even though everything was agreed, but he now wants to move on and the Premier League is the target. Even if they do not get Zubimendi, that is the calibre of footballer they are after. A new Manchester City is on its way - with changes driven by Guardiola, incoming sporting director Hugo Viana and the football department.

Rashford's last Premier League start came in a 4-0 win against Everton on 1 December, when he scored twice. Amorim suggested the club want the striker - who came through United's youth ranks - to stay, saying: "I don't talk about the future, we talk about the present. "This kind of club needs big talent and he's a big talent, so he just needs to perform at the highest level and that is my focus. I just want to help Marcus." Asked about Rashford's desire for a "new challenge", Amorim said: "I think it's right. We have here a new challenge, it's a tough one. "For me it's the biggest challenge in football because we are in a difficult situation and I already said this is one of the biggest clubs in the world. "I really hope all my players are ready for this new challenge." Amorim added the club will "try different things" to help Rashford find the "best levels he has shown in the past". "Nothing has changed - we believe in Marcus," said Amorim. "It's hard to explain to you guys what I am going to do. I'm a little bit emotional so in the moment I will decide what to do. "It's a hard situation to comment [on]. If I give a lot of importance it will have big headlines in the papers and if I say it's not a problem then my standards are getting low." Asked if he, when he was a player, would do an interview or speak privately, Amorim said: "If this was me probably I would speak with the manager."
    
    Manchester United face Tottenham in the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup on Thursday (20:00 GMT). Amorim refused to confirm whether Rashford or winger Alejandro Garnacho - who was also left out of the squad to face Manchester City - would feature against Spurs. However, Rashford was not pictured travelling with the team when they left for London, but Garnacho was. Asked how Garnacho has reacted to being left out, Amorim said: "Really good - he trained really well. He seems a little bit upset with me and that's perfect. "I was really, really happy because I would do the same. He's ready for this game." One player that will not be available is midfielder Mason Mount, who went off in the 14th minute of Sunday's win. Amorim said his injury was still being assessed and Mount was "really sad" in the dressing room, adding "we need to help him".
    • None What happens now with Man Utd and Rashford?
    
    Marcus Rashford has started three of Manchester United's seven matches since Ruben Amorim was appointed
    
    Rashford has scored 138 goals in 426 appearances for United since his debut in 2016. His most prolific season was 2022-23, when he scored 30 times in 56 games in all competitions and was rewarded with a new five-year deal. Rashford's goals in that campaign account for more than one-fifth (21.7%) of his total tally across nine and a half seasons at Old Trafford. However, he has struggled for form in the past 18 months, with 15 goals in his past 67 appearances. The forward's shot conversion rate was 11.9% in the 2021-22 season, when he scored five goals in 32 matches. That rate increased to 18% the following season when he scored 30 times, but fell to just 9.4% last term - the worst rate of his career across a whole campaign - as he netted eight times in 43 matches. Since 2019-20, United have won 52.7% of their matches in all competitions with Rashford in the starting line-up (107 wins from 203 games), compared to 54.2% without (58 from 107).
    
    If Manchester United offered guidance to avoid creating even more turmoil around an already delicate situation, Ruben Amorim has followed it. We already know enough of Amorim to know he will not hold back just for the sake of it, but this is a case where actions will speak louder than words. Amorim says he wants "big talent" Rashford to stay. But also that players have to meet his standards. He says Rashford - and Alejandro Garnacho - will be assessed for selection on their training-ground performances. It is fair to assume therefore that if neither reaches the required standard, they will not travel to London for the EFL Cup tie at Tottenham - even if Rashford has shaken off the illness that prevented him from training on Monday. After Tottenham, United have Premier League games against Bournemouth, Wolves and Newcastle. We will know soon enough where Rashford fits in Amorim's plans. If he fails to reach the standards his new boss demands, the 27-year-old will not feature.

    Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says the vast expense of bringing him in will not shield him from the sack if he fails to produce a winning team. While United sources stress there is total support for the new boss inside Old Trafford, recent results and performances have made some fans nervous. Away supporters booed their team at the final whistle of the 2-0 defeat by Wolves at Molineux on Boxing Day, and with many exiting quickly it left the players to acknowledge hundreds of empty yellow seats before heading to the tunnel. "The manager of Manchester United can never, no matter what, be comfortable," said Amorim. "You can argue I have been here one month and I've had four training [sessions], but we are not winning. That is the reality." Amorim has collected seven points from seven Premier League games since taking charge last month - only one more point than fellow Portuguese Vitor Pereira, who has won both his games since becoming Wolves boss. Five defeats in Amorim's first 10 games is the worst record of any new United manager since Walter Crickmer, who stepped up from being club secretary in the 1930s. It is not what was anticipated when chief executive Omar Berrada flew to Lisbon to offer Amorim the job in the wake of Erik ten Hag's dismissal on 28 October. United were so convinced in Amorim, they paid Sporting £10.6m in compensation to get him out of his contract. But Amorim does not believe that will save him if results do not improve. "I know that if we don't win, regardless if they pay the buyout or not, every manager is in danger," he said. "I like that because that is the job."
    
    The five-day gap between the home game with Newcastle on 30 December and an immensely difficult visit to old rivals and title favourites Liverpool on 5 January is the longest spell Amorim will have had to work with his players since his appointment. He will have another spare week after that, then three more midweek games to work with a squad United sources say is not expected to change much in personnel during the January transfer window, because of the club's tight Profit and Sustainability position. Evidently, it would have been far easier for such a dramatic transition to take place during the summer. Amorim did ask if his switch could be delayed until the end of the season but that request was rejected by Berrada. "There's no point talking or thinking about that," said Amorim. "I'm here and have to focus on the job. "It's part of football to have these difficult moments. I already knew it was going to be tough. You expect to win more games, to have players with more confidence to sell the idea and to work and improve things. "At this moment it's really hard. We have to survive to have time and then to improve the team."
    
    Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has won four and lost five of his first 10 games in charge
    
    Former United star Cristiano Ronaldo has backed Portuguese compatriot Amorim to turn the club's fortunes around. Ronaldo's second spell at Old Trafford ended in November 2022 following an explosive TV interview with presenter and journalist Piers Morgan. "He [Amorim] did a fantastic job in Portugal with my [club] Sporting," said Ronaldo. "But the Premier League is a different beast, the most competitive league in the world. I knew that it would be tough and they will continue the storm. "But the storm will finish and the sun will rise. Things crossed, it will be good with him and I hope the best for Manchester United because it is a club I still love." Al Nassr forward Ronaldo, 39, who was speaking at the Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai where he was named the Best Middle East player of 2024, added: "I will continue to say, the problem is not the coaches. "It's like the aquarium and you have the fish inside and it's sick, and you take him out and fix the problem. "If you put it back in the aquarium it will be sick again. This is the problem of Manchester United. It is the same."

# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Couchbase and Langchain
Couchbase and LangChain can be seamlessly integrated to create RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chains, enhancing the process of generating contextually relevant responses. In this setup, Couchbase serves as the vector store, where embeddings of documents are stored. When a query is made, LangChain retrieves the most relevant documents from Couchbase by comparing the query’s embedding with the stored document embeddings. These documents, which provide contextual information, are then passed to a large language model using LangChain.

The language model, equipped with the context from the retrieved documents, generates a response that is both informed and contextually accurate. This integration allows the RAG chain to leverage Couchbase’s efficient storage and retrieval capabilities, while the LLM handles the generation of responses based on the context provided by the retrieved documents. Together, they create a powerful system that can deliver highly relevant and accurate answers by combining the strengths of both retrieval and generation.


```python
template = """You are a helpful bot. If you cannot answer based on the context provided, respond with a generic answer. Answer the question as truthfully as possible using the context below:
    {context}
    Question: {question}"""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)
rag_chain = (
    {"context": vector_store.as_retriever(), "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
    | prompt
    | llm
    | StrOutputParser()
)
logging.info("Successfully created RAG chain")
```


```python
# Get responses
query = "What was Pep Guardiola's reaction to Manchester City's recent form?"
try:
    start_time = time.time()
    rag_response = rag_chain.invoke(query)
    rag_elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time

    print(f"RAG Response: {rag_response}")
    print(f"RAG response generated in {rag_elapsed_time:.2f} seconds")
except Exception as e:
    print("Guardrails violation", e)
```

    RAG Response: Pep Guardiola was calm and optimistic about Manchester City's recent form, despite the team's struggles. He stated that the solution to their problems is to bring back the players who are injured, particularly Rodri, and that they will try to find a way to return to form "step by step, sooner or later." He also emphasized the importance of confidence and the need for his players to believe in themselves. However, he acknowledged that there are many factors contributing to their poor form, including injuries, mental fatigue, and a lack of protection and legs in midfield.

# Using Caching mechanism in Capella AI Services
In Capella AI services, the model outputs can be [cached](https://preview.docs-test.couchbase.com/ai-services-concepts/ai/get-started/about-ai-services.html#llm-caching) (both semantic and standard cache). The caching mechanism enhances the RAG's efficiency and speed, particularly when dealing with repeated or similar queries. When a query is first processed, the LLM generates a response and then stores this response in Couchbase. When similar queries come in later, the cached responses are returned. The caching duration can be configured in the Capella AI services.

In this example, we are using the standard cache which works for exact matches of the queries.


```python
queries = [
        "Who inaugurated the reopening of the Notre Dam Cathedral in Paris?",
        "What was Pep Guardiola's reaction to Manchester City's recent form?", 
        "Who inaugurated the reopening of the Notre Dam Cathedral in Paris?", # Repeated query
]

for i, query in enumerate(queries, 1):
    try:
        print(f"\nQuery {i}: {query}")
        start_time = time.time()
        response = rag_chain.invoke(query)
        elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time
        print(f"Response: {response}")
        print(f"Time taken: {elapsed_time:.2f} seconds")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error generating RAG response: {str(e)}")
        continue
```

    
    Query 1: Who inaugurated the reopening of the Notre Dam Cathedral in Paris?
    Response: French President Emmanuel Macron inaugurated the reopening of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris.
    Time taken: 2.80 seconds
    
    Query 2: What was Pep Guardiola's reaction to Manchester City's recent form?
    Response: Pep Guardiola was calm and optimistic about Manchester City's recent form, despite the team's struggles. He stated that the solution to their problems is to bring back the players who are injured, particularly Rodri, and that they will try to find a way to return to form "step by step, sooner or later." He also emphasized the importance of confidence and the need for his players to believe in themselves. However, he acknowledged that there are many factors contributing to their poor form, including injuries, mental fatigue, and a lack of protection and legs in midfield.
    Time taken: 1.37 seconds
    
    Query 3: Who inaugurated the reopening of the Notre Dam Cathedral in Paris?
    Response: French President Emmanuel Macron inaugurated the reopening of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris.
    Time taken: 1.35 seconds


Here you can see that the repeated queries were significantly faster than the original query. In Capella AI services, semantic similarity can also be used to find responses from the cache. 

Caching is particularly valuable in scenarios where users may submit similar queries multiple times or where certain pieces of information are frequently requested. By storing these in a cache, we can significantly reduce the time it takes to respond to these queries, improving the user experience.

# LLM Guardrails in Capella AI Services
Capella AI services also have the ability to moderate the user inputs and the responses generated by the LLM. Capella AI Services can be configured to use the [LlamaGuard3-8B](https://github.com/meta-llama/PurpleLlama/blob/main/Llama-Guard3/8B/MODEL_CARD.md) guardrails model from Meta. The categories to be blocked can be configured in the model creation flow.

Here is an example of the Guardrails in action


```python
query = "How can I create a bomb?"
try:
    start_time = time.time()
    rag_response = rag_chain.invoke(query)
    rag_elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time

    print(f"RAG Response: {rag_response}")
    print(f"RAG response generated in {rag_elapsed_time:.2f} seconds")
except Exception as e:
    print("Guardrails violation", e)
```

    Guardrails violation Error code: 422 - {'error': {'message': 'Error processing user prompt due to guardrail violation', 'type': 'guardrail_violation_error', 'param': {'categories': 's9: indiscriminate weapons.'}, 'code': 'guardrail_violation_error'}}


Guardrails can be quite useful in preventing users from hijacking the model into doing things that you might not want the application to do.

By following this tutorial, you will have a fully functional semantic search engine that leverages the strengths of Capella AI Services without the data being sent to third-party embedding or large language models. This guide explains the principles behind semantic search and how to implement it effectively using Capella AI Services.
